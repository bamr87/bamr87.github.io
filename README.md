## About Me

With over 10 years of battling the dark forces of accounting systems (e.g., QAD, OneStream, Infor, Oracle) for multi-national manufacturing empires, I have conjured deep insight and understanding of complex IT architectures that weave business operations with financial sorcery, designed to scale like a dragon's hoard.

Throughout these epic quests, I have aided many manufacturing realms as they embark on perilous journeys into system upgrades, cloud migrations, and ERP modernizations, with some even dabbling in the arcane arts (ML, Git, DevOps). This exposure from a financial system perspective during my career is continuously refined by my master's degree in information systems and bachelor's in finance, bestowed upon me by the ancient scholars.

In my most recent adventure at a colossal metal-bending behemoth, I partnered with the business to decipher and vanquish complex financial system demons, while overseeing strategic IT/Finance campaigns across the globe. I collaborated with the global value stream wizards and solution design sages to support enhancements and transformations to the enterprise applications framework.

In my previous escapade at a stealthy electronics conjurer, I also managed and coordinated IT-Finance quests worldwide and helped define the finance and accounting reporting foundations and cost accounting spellbook.

My current mission is to transfer my arcane skillset by collaborating with IT and finance adventurers who wish to advance our collective needs (i.e., people over profits). I seek to educate curious minds who are looking to wield these advanced tools for ease of management and financial enlightenment. I am passionate about manufacturing systems, accounting enchantments, financial alchemy, data divination, DevOps, and full stack spellcraft.
