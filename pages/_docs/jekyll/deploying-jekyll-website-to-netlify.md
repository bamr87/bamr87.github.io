> Deploy static website built with Jekyll to Netlify.

## 1. Jekyll & GitHub Pages & Netlify

I'm using Jekyll to build my personal website [{{ site.github_user }}.github.io]({{ site.github_user }}.github.io). All its content are static, which are built by Jekyll. Currently, it is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It works fine, however, there are some limitations with GitHub Pages. For example, it is not possible to specify Http Header for caching.

On the other hand, Netlify supports more features than GitHub Pages and it is also free. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is an online service which builds, deploys, and manages modern web projects.  Netlify basically initiates its own kind of repository that pushes both to a Github repository and its own services. It offers hosting for front-end projects with many options.

## 2. Deploying Application From Github Repository

### 2.1 Preparation

Since I'm deploying a Jekyll website, run the following commands in local repository to update `Gemfile.lock`. Netlify will use this file for the deployment.

```raw
bundle install
bundle update
```

### 2.2 New Netlify Account

If you don't have netlify account yet, go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) to create a Netlify account with your GitHub account. Once you have the account, follow the steps below to deploy static website to Netlify.

### 2.3 New Site from GitHub

After login, you are in the app home page, click 'New site from Git'.
