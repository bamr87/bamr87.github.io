> Handle error 'Address Already in Use' when starting Jekyll.

## 1. Issue of 'Address Already in Use'

I've set up my [GitHub Page website](http://{{ site.github_user }}.github.io/) locally. It works as expected. But sometimes, I'm unable to start Jekyll. I keep getting the following error after running 'jekyll serve' command.

```raw
jekyll 3.5.2 | Error:  Address already in use - bind(2) for 127.0.0.1:4000
```

Port 4000 has already been occupied. To solve this issue, kill the process that is using this port.  
Find the process which is using port 4000.

```raw
sudo lsof -i :4000
```

Kill the process with its id.

```raw
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

Retry 'jekyll serve', the error 'Port Already in Use' is gone.

## 2. NoMachine Process

Similar problem - Port 4000 is occupied by NoMachine(nxd).

```raw
Johnny@Johnny-Mac:~$ sudo lsof -i :4000
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
nxd     11199   nx    3u  IPv4 0x2fad2a11645a3de5      0t0  TCP *:terabase (LISTEN)
nxd     11199   nx    4u  IPv6 0x2fad2a115cded5bd      0t0  TCP *:terabase (LISTEN)
```

Killing the thread won't work, because NoMachine's nxd process will keep restarting, with a new PID. Either you have to change the port for your app. Or, change the service port for NoMachine. NoMachine->Preferences->Connection preferences.

We can also shutdown NoMachine and disable the automatic start at next boot via command line.

On Linux:

```raw
sudo /etc/NX/nxserver --shutdown
sudo /etc/NX/nxserver --startmode manual
```

On Mac:

```raw
sudo /etc/NX/nxserver --shutdown
sudo /etc/NX/nxserver --startmode manual
```

On Windows:
Open the CMD console as administrator and move to the bin folder under the NoMachine installation directory and run:

```raw
nxserver --shutdown
nxserver --startmode manual
```
