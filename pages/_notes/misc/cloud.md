# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

## 1.1 Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition

### Question 1

**Which of the following are benefits of the AWS Cloud? (Select TWO.)**

A - Companies need increased IT staff.

Incorrect. With the AWS Cloud, you can focus on your customers, rather than on the acquisition, installation, and management of infrastructure. Although the use of AWS services might offload some of the work your IT staff performs, it will not directly increase your IT staff.

B - Capital expenses are replaced with variable expenses.

Correct. With the AWS Cloud, you benefit from Amazon's global purchasing of compute resources. You do not need to invest heavily in data centers.

C - Customers receive the same monthly bill regardless of which resources they use.

Incorrect. With the AWS Cloud, you pay only for the individual services that you need, for as long as you use them. You are not required to commit to a long-term contract.

For more information about flexible pricing on the AWS platform, see AWS Pricing.

D - Companies gain increased agility.

Correct. With the AWS Cloud, you make IT resources available to developers in minutes instead of weeks. The result is reduced cost and time for development, which increases agility.

For more information about agility, see Six Advantages of Cloud Computing.

E - AWS holds responsibility for security in the cloud.

Incorrect. The customer is responsible for security in the AWS Cloud as part of the AWS shared responsibility model.

For more information about security in the AWS Cloud, see Shared Responsibility Model.

#### Question 2

**Which of the following are advantages of the AWS Cloud? (Select TWO.)**

A - AWS manages the maintenance of the cloud infrastructure.

Correct. This solution is an example of security "of" the cloud. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

B - AWS manages the security of applications built on AWS.

Incorrect. This solution is an example of security "in" the cloud. Application security is the customer's responsibility.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

C - AWS manages capacity planning for physical servers.

Correct. This solution is an example of security "of" the cloud. Capacity planning of the cloud is an inherited control from AWS. AWS purchases additional servers as needed, based on overall customer demand.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

D - AWS manages the development of applications on AWS.

Incorrect. This solution is an example of security "in" the cloud. AWS does not manage application development.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

E - AWS manages cost planning for virtual servers.

Incorrect. AWS offers tools to help customers visualize, understand, and manage costs. Customers are responsible for cost planning for their virtual servers.

For more information about cost planning tools, see AWS Cost Explorer.

## 1.2 Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics

### Question 3

**A company requires physical isolation of its Amazon EC2 instances from the instances of other customers.**

**Which instance purchasing option meets this requirement?**

A - Dedicated Hosts

Correct. With Dedicated Hosts, a physical server is dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts provide visibility and the option to control how you place your instances on an isolated, physical server.

For more information about Dedicated Hosts, see Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts.

B - Reserved Instances

Incorrect. Reserved Instances are not physical instances. Reserved Instances are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. Reserved Instances do not provide physical workload isolation.

For more information about Reserved Instances, see Reserved Instances.

C - On-Demand Instances

Incorrect. With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. On-Demand Instances do not provide physical workload isolation.

For more information about On-Demand Instances, see On-Demand Instances.

D - Spot Instances

Incorrect. With Spot Instances, you can take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS Cloud. Spot Instances do not provide physical workload isolation.

For more information about Spot Instances, see Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.

## 1.3 Explain the different cloud architecture design principles

### Question 4

**Which AWS Cloud architecture principle states that systems should reduce interdependencies?**

A - Scalability

Incorrect. Systems that are scalable can react to increases and decreases in load. Scalability does not reduce interdependencies between system components.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

B - Services, not servers

Incorrect. This solution does not reduce interdependencies between system components in an application deployment. However, you still need to design features that are decoupled within the application to reduce single endpoints that can become failures.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

C - Automation

Incorrect. Automation can improve stability, efficiency during deployments, and the response to events. However, you still need to design architecture that reduces tight dependencies between the layers of the application.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

D - Loose coupling

Correct. Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a component from other components that depend on it, increasing resiliency and agility. A change or a failure in one of the components should not affect the other components.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

### Question 5

Which AWS Cloud architecture design principle supports the distribution of workloads across multiple Availability Zones?

A - Implement automation.

Incorrect. You can use automation services, such as AWS CloudFormation, to deploy resources into one or more Availability Zones. However, the implementation of automation is not directly tied to, or limited to, the distribution of workloads across multiple Availability Zones.

For more information about CloudFormation, see AWS CloudFormation FAQs.

B - Design for agility.

Incorrect. When you design for agility, you can provision resources more quickly. Agility is not related to the number of Availability Zones.

For more information about agility, see Risk is Lack of Agility.

C - Design for failure.

Correct. AWS recommends that you distribute workloads across multiple Availability Zones. This distribution will ensure continuous availability of your application, even if the application is unavailable in one single Availability Zone.

For more information about the performance efficiency pillar, see Performance Efficiency Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework.

D - Implement elasticity.

Incorrect. Elasticity is the ability to activate resources as you need them and return resources when you no longer need them. Elasticity is not related to the number of Availability Zones.

For more information about elasticity, see Elasticity.

## 2.1 Define the AWS shared responsibility model

### Question 6

**Which of the following is a responsibility of AWS under the AWS shared responsibility model?**

A - Design a customer's application for disaster recovery.

Incorrect. AWS offers many services to help with disaster recovery and business continuity planning. However, according to the shared responsibility model, it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to decide which services it needs.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

B - Update the guest operating systems on deployed Amazon EC2 instances.

Incorrect. The customer must manage its own updates on its provisioned infrastructure.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

C - Configure new resources within an AWS account.

Incorrect. The customer decides which services to use and how to use them.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

D  - Secure the physical infrastructure.

Correct. AWS fully maintains the physical controls.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

## 2.2 Define AWS Cloud security and compliance concepts

### Question 7

**Which of the following describes a security best practice that can be implemented by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)?**

A - Turn off AWS Management Console access for all users.

Incorrect. There could be legitimate requirements for certain IAM users to have access to the console. Consequently, to turn off access for all users is not the correct solution.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

B - Generate secret keys for every IAM user.

Incorrect. This solution would generate secret keys for IAM users and would require them to access their applications through programmatic access.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

C - Grant permissions to users who are required to perform a specific task only.

Correct. Through the security recommendation of least privilege, an IAM best practice is to grant granular permissions to users by using IAM roles.

For more information about IAM best practices and least privilege, see Grant least privilege.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

D - Store AWS credentials within Amazon EC2 instances.

Incorrect. The solution to store credentials within EC2 instances is not a security best practice. It would be a better security practice to use IAM roles to grant permissions to EC2 instances, because the IAM roles will rotate the credentials automatically.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

### Question 8

A company needs to monitor and receive alerts about AWS Management Console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

Which AWS service can the company use to meet these requirements?

A - Amazon CloudWatch

Correct. CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to monitor and receive alerts about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about CloudWatch, see What is Amazon CloudWatch?

B - AWS Config

Incorrect. You can use AWS Config to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. AWS Config cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about AWS Config, see What is AWS Config?

C - AWS Trusted Advisor

Incorrect. You can use Trusted Advisor for real-time guidance to help you provision your resources according to AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about Trusted Advisor, see AWS Trusted Advisor.

D - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Incorrect. With IAM, you can manage access to AWS services and resources securely. IAM cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about IAM, see AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## 2.3 Identify AWS access management capabilities

### Question 9

**A company has an application server that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application server needs to access contents within a private Amazon S3 bucket.**

**What is the recommended approach to meet this requirement?**

A - Create an IAM role with the appropriate permissions. Associate the role with the EC2 instance.

Correct. IAM roles are temporary credentials that expire. IAM roles are more secure than long-term access keys because they reduce risk if credentials are accidentally exposed.

For more information about IAM roles, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.

B - Configure a VPC peering connection to allow private communication between the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket.

Incorrect. A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them by using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. VPC peering connections cannot connect a VPC and an S3 bucket.

For more information about VPC peering, see What is VPC peering?

C - Create a shared access key. Configure the EC2 instance to use the hardcoded key.

Incorrect. The creation of a shared key is not a best practice because this reduces the value of auditing AWS resource access. It is not a best practice to embed access keys into the application code because application code can become compromised.

For more information about managing access keys, see Best practices for managing AWS access keys.

D - Configure the application to read an access key from a secured source.

Incorrect. It is a best practice to use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys. Long-term access keys, such as those associated with IAM users and AWS account root users, remain valid until you manually revoke them. However, temporary security credentials that are obtained through IAM roles and other features of AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) expire after a short period of time. Use temporary security credentials to help reduce the risk in case credentials are accidentally exposed.

For more information about managing access keys, see Best practices for managing AWS access keys.

## 2.4 Identify resources for security support

### Question 10

Which security-related services or features does AWS offer? (Select TWO.)

For more information about penetration testing, see Penetration Testing.

E - Amazon S3 copyrighted content detection

Incorrect. AWS provides copyrighted content detection.

### Question 11

**Which recommendations are included in the AWS Trusted Advisor checks? (Select TWO.)**

A - Amazon S3 bucket permissions

Correct. Trusted Advisor checks for S3 bucket permissions in Amazon S3 with open access permissions. Bucket permissions that grant list access to everyone can result in higher than expected charges if objects in the bucket are listed by unintended users at a high frequency. Bucket permissions that grant upload and delete access to all users create potential security vulnerabilities by allowing anyone to add, modify, or remove items in a bucket. This Trusted Advisor check examines explicit bucket permissions and associated bucket policies that might override the bucket permissions.

For more information about S3 bucket permissions, see AWS Trusted Advisor best practice checklist.

B - AWS service outages for services

Incorrect. Trusted Advisor does not provide notifications for service outages. You can use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard to learn about AWS Health events that can affect your AWS services or account.

For more information about the Personal Health Dashboard, see Getting started with the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.

C - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) use on the AWS account root user

**Which aspect of AWS infrastructure provides global deployment of compute and storage?**

A - Multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region

Incorrect. Availability Zones are one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in a Region. When infrastructure is deployed across multiple Availability Zones, you can achieve a highly available deployment within the geographical location of the Region. However, this solution does not provide global deployments.

For more information about Availability Zones, see Global Infrastructure.

B - Multiple AWS Regions

Correct. A Region is a physical location where there are clusters of AWS data centers. AWS offers many different Regions where you can deploy infrastructure around the world. With the use of multiple Regions, you can achieve a global deployment of compute, storage, and databases.

For more information about Regions, see Global Infrastructure.

C - Tags

Incorrect. Tags are metadata that you can associate with AWS resources. Tags are user-defined data in the form of key-value pairs. You can use tags to manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. Tags do not provide global deployments of applications and solutions.

For more information about tags, see Tagging AWS resources.

D - Resource groups

Incorrect. AWS Resource Groups is a service that you can use to manage and automate tasks on many resources at the same time. Resources in AWS are entities such as Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon S3 buckets. With Resource Groups, you can filter resources based on tags or AWS CloudFormation stacks and then perform an action against a group of resources. You do not use Resource Groups to deploy AWS resources globally.

For more information about resource groups, see What are AWS Resource Groups?

### Question 14

**Which AWS services or features support data replication across AWS Regions? (Select TWO.)**

A - Amazon S3

Correct. Amazon S3 supports Cross-Region Replication. With Cross-Region Replication, you designate a destination S3 bucket in another Region. When Cross-Region Replication is turned on, any new object that is uploaded will be replicated to the destination S3 bucket.

For more information about Amazon S3, see Replicating objects.

B - Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

Incorrect. Amazon EBS automatically replicates data within an Availability Zone. Amazon EBS does not support Cross-Region Replication.

For more information about Amazon EBS, see Amazon Elastic Block Store.

C - Amazon EC2 instance store

Incorrect. An EC2 instance store is block storage that is attached to an EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. An instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently. The data that is stored on an instance store is temporary. There is no built-in mechanism to replicate data across Regions.

For more information about EC2 instance stores, see Amazon EC2 instance store.

D - AWS Storage Gateway

Incorrect. Storage Gateway connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage. Storage Gateway provides integration with data security features between your on-premises IT environment and AWS storage infrastructure such as Amazon S3. Storage Gateway does not directly support Cross-Region Replication.

For more information about Storage Gateway, see What is AWS Storage Gateway?

E - Amazon RDS

Correct. You can use Amazon RDS to host relational databases on AWS. One RDS DB instance resides in a single Region. With Amazon RDS, you can create read replicas across Regions. Amazon RDS replicates any data from the primary DB instance to the read replica across Regions.

For more information about Amazon RDS, see Working with read replicas.

## 3.3 Identify the core AWS services

### Question 15

**A company is hosting a static website from a single Amazon S3 bucket.**

**Which AWS service will achieve lower latency and high transfer speeds?**

A - AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Incorrect. Elastic Beanstalk is a service to deploy and scale web applications and services developed with common programming languages on automatically deployed infrastructure with capacity management, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk makes it easier to provision and support an application. Elastic Beanstalk does not reduce website latency.

For more information about Elastic Beanstalk, see What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

B - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Incorrect. DAX is used to reduce response times from a DynamoDB table from single-digit milliseconds to microseconds. DynamoDB tables cannot host static websites.

For more information about DAX, see In-Memory Acceleration with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).

C - Amazon Route 53

Incorrect. Route 53 is a highly available and scalable DNS web service. The three main functions of Route 53 are registering domain names, routing internet traffic to the resources for your domain, and checking the health of those resources. Route 53 can direct traffic to S3 buckets. But because the question describes only one S3 bucket, Route 53 would have only one potential route and could not reduce latency.

For more information about Route 53, see What is Amazon Route 53?

For more information about routing to S3 buckets by using Route 53, see Routing traffic to a website that is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket.

D - Amazon CloudFront

Correct. CloudFront is a web service that speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. Content is cached in edge locations. Content that is repeatedly accessed can be served from the edge locations instead of the source S3 bucket.

For more information about CloudFront, see Accelerate static website content delivery.

### Question 16

**Which AWS service provides a simple and scalable shared file storage solution for use with Linux-based Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers?**

A - AWS Managed Services (AMS)

Incorrect. AMS helps you to operate your AWS infrastructure more efficiently and securely. By using AWS services and a growing library of automations, configurations, and run books, AMS can augment and optimize your operational capabilities in both new and existing AWS environments. However, AMS is not a storage service.

For more information about AMS, see AWS Managed Services.

B - Amazon S3 Glacier

Incorrect. S3 Glacier is an object store used for archiving purposes. It is not suitable for one time access.

For more information about S3 Glacier, see What Is Amazon S3 Glacier?

C - Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

Incorrect. Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. However, EBS volumes cannot be shared between on-premises servers and EC2 instances.

For more information about Amazon EBS, see Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).

D - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

Correct. Amazon EFS provides an elastic file system that lets you share file data without the need to provision and manage storage. It can be used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources, and is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications. With Amazon EFS, you can grow and shrink your file systems automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.

For more information about using Amazon EFS, see Walkthrough: Create and mount a file system on premises with AWS Direct Connect and VPN.

Correct. By creating separate aliases for Production and Development, systems can initiate the correct alias as needed. A Lambda function alias can be used to point to a specific Lambda function version. Using the functionality to update an alias and its linked version, the development team can update the required version as needed. The $LATEST version is the newest published version.

For more information about Lambda function aliases, see Lambda function aliases.

Each time a developer publishes a new version of an AWS Lambda function, all the dependent event source mappings need to be updated with the reference to the new versionâ€™s Amazon Resource Name (ARN). These updates are time consuming and error-prone.

Which combination of actions should the developer take to avoid performing these updates when publishing a new Lambda version? (Select TWO.)

Report Content Errors

A
Update event source mappings with the ARN of the Lambda layer.

Incorrect. A Lambda event source mapping can either point to the version ARN, or an alias ARN, but not to the layer ARN.

For more information about managing Lambda function versions by using an ARN, see Lambda function versions.

For more information about creating and using Lambda function aliases, see Lambda function aliases.

For more information about Lambda layers, see Creating and sharing Lambda layers.


B
Point a Lambda alias to a new version of the Lambda function.

Correct. A Lambda alias is a pointer to a specific Lambda function version.

For more information about creating and using Lambda function aliases, see Lambda function aliases.


C
Create a Lambda alias for each published version of the Lambda function.

Incorrect. This solution does not address your problem. Every alias has its own unique ARN. Therefore, you would still need to update the event source mapping with the new ARN when a new version is published.

For more information about creating and using Lambda function aliases, see Lambda function aliases.


D
Point a Lambda alias to a new Lambda function alias.

Incorrect. A Lambda alias cannot point to another Lambda alias, only to a Lambda function version.

For more information about Lambda function aliases, including their creation and management, see Using aliases.


E
Update the event source mappings with the Lambda alias ARN.

Correct. Instead of using ARNs for the Lambda function in event source mappings, you can use an alias ARN. You do not need to update your event source mappings when you promote a new version or roll back to a previous version.

An application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances needs credentials to make an API call to Amazon DynamoDB.

What is the MOST secure method to provide credentials to perform the call?

Report Content Errors

A
Create a user and a password with the needed permissions. Store the credentials in a configuration file on the EC2 instances.

Incorrect. You could store AWS credentials directly within the EC2 instances and allow applications that run on those instances to use those credentials. However, you would have to manage the credentials. You would have to securely pass the credentials to each instance and update each instance when it is time to rotate the credentials. This approach is not the most secure solution.

For more information about using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on EC2 instances, see Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#use-roles-with-ec2


B
Assign an IAM role with the correct permissions to the DynamoDB table.

Incorrect. While roles are the most secure way to provide these credentials, it is the EC2 instance that is making the API call. The instances, not the DynamoDB table, need to be assigned the proper credentials.

For more information about using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on EC2 instances, see Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#use-roles-with-ec2


C
Assign an IAM role with the correct permissions to the EC2 instances.

Correct. The most secure method is to create an IAM role with the appropriate policy. Attach that IAM role to the EC2 instance that is making the API call. Long-term credentials are not stored, which reduces risk of compromising the credentials.

For more information about using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on EC2 instances, see Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances.


D
Add the name of an IAM policy with the correct permissions to a configuration file on the instances.

Incorrect. IAM policies are associated with IAM identities (users, groups, or roles) or AWS resources. A configuration file of instances is not an IAM identity or an AWS resource. Therefore, an IAM policy cannot be associated with it.

A company wants to store sensitive user data in Amazon S3 and encrypt this data at rest. The company must manage the encryption keys and use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.

How can a developer meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Enable default encryption for the S3 bucket by using the option for server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).

Incorrect. The default encryption behavior for an S3 bucket can be configured to either SSE-S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) (SSE-KMS). Although you can upload files with SSE-C, you cannot set it as a default S3 bucket encryption.

For more information about S3 encryption, see Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets.


B
Enable client-side encryption with an encryption key. Upload the encrypted object to the S3 bucket.

Incorrect. Client-side encryption involves encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3. This solution does not meet the requirement for Amazon to provide the encryption.

For more information about client-side encryption for S3 buckets, see Protecting data using client-side encryption.


C
Enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Upload an object to the S3 bucket.

Which combination of steps will meet the requirement for the encryption of specific data items? (Select TWO.)

Report Content Errors

A
Generate symmetric encryption keys with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

Correct. When the DynamoDB Encryption Client is configured to use AWS KMS, it uses a customer master key (CMK) that is always encrypted when used outside of AWS KMS. This cryptographic materials provider returns a unique encryption key and signing key for every table item. This method of encryption uses a symmetric CMK.

For more information about the Direct KMS Materials Provider used by the DynamoDB Encryption Client, see Direct KMS Materials Provider.

For more information about CMKs, see AWS Key Management Service concepts.


B
Generate asymmetric encryption keys with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

Incorrect. When the DynamoDB Encryption Client is configured to use AWS KMS, it uses a customer master key (CMK) that is always encrypted when used outside of AWS KMS. This cryptographic materials provider returns a unique encryption key and signing key for every table item. This method of encryption would require a symmetric CMK, not an asymmetric key.

For more information about the Direct KMS Materials Provider, see Direct KMS Materials Provider.

For more information about CMKs, see AWS Key Management Service concepts.


C
Use generated keys with the DynamoDB Encryption Client.

Correct. The DynamoDB Encryption Client provides end-to-end protection for your data in transit and at rest. You can encrypt selected items or attribute values in a table.

A
Configure an Amazon S3 event notification that publishes to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Each service pulls the message from the same queue.

Incorrect. After a consumer retrieves and processes a message from a queue, it deletes the message in the queue. The result is that only one service receives the message.

For more information about Amazon SQS architecture, see Basic Amazon SQS architecture.


B
Configure an Amazon S3 event notification that publishes to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Each service subscribes to the same topic.

Incorrect. An Amazon SQS delivery policy defines how Amazon SNS retries the delivery of messages when a delivery error occurs. Amazon SNS stops retrying the delivery and discards the message when a delivery policy is exhausted. If one of the services is temporarily unavailable, it would not receive the message.

For more information about Amazon SNS message delivery retries, see Amazon SNS message delivery retries.


C
Configure an Amazon S3 event notification that publishes to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Subscribe a separate Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for each service to an Amazon SQS queue.

How can the developer store the session state and share it across the EC2 instances?

Report Content Errors

A
Write the sessions to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Configure the application to poll the stream.

Incorrect. A Kinesis data stream is used for data ingestion and for processing of data records. However, it does not have the features needed for this use case. ElastiCache is better suited for this requirement.

For more information about Kinesis, see Getting started with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.


B
Publish the sessions to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe each instance in the group to the topic.

Incorrect. Amazon SNS is used for publish-subscribe messaging. Messages are delivered as soon as they are sent. Amazon SNS is not designed to store persistent session data.

For more information about SNS, see Amazon SNS FAQs.


C
Store the sessions in an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster. Configure the application to use the Memcached API.

A developer is writing a component that will read customer orders from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and process them. The developer wants to reduce empty responses to the ReceiveMessage call and obtain a customer order message as soon as it is available.

What should the developer do when writing code to retrieve messages from the queue?

Report Content Errors

A
Use SQS short polling.

Incorrect. SQS short polling queries only a random subset of the servers for messages. To retrieve all messages, you might need multiple short queries. If the selected servers do not contain any messages, then empty responses would be sent. Additionally, short polling sends a response right away. These factors could result in empty responses.

For more information about SQS queries, see Amazon SQS short and long polling.


B
Use SQS long polling.

Correct. SQS long polling queries all servers for messages and sends a response after it collects at least one available message. Additionally, long polling would send an empty response only if the queue is empty and the polling wait time expires.

For more information about SQS queries, see Amazon SQS short and long polling.

For more information about the ReceiveMessage API call, see ReceiveMessage.


C
Extend the visibility timeout.

Incorrect. When a consumer receives and processes a message from an SQS queue, the message remains in the queue until the consumer deletes the message from the queue. To avoid other consumers from processing the same message, you can specify a visibility timeout value. A visibility timeout value is a period of time during which SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message.

For more information about visibility timeouts for Amazon SQS, see Amazon SQS visibility timeout.


D
Increase the maximum number of messages to return.

A developer has written several custom applications that read and write to the same Amazon DynamoDB table. Each time the data in the DynamoDB table is modified, this change should be sent to an external API.

Which combination of steps should the developer perform to accomplish this task? (Select TWO.)

Report Content Errors

A
Configure an AWS Lambda function to poll the stream and call the external API.

Correct. If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with an Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the table's stream. Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda function synchronously when it detects new stream records.

Which minimal code refactoring is necessary for the CRUD operations to run in the Lambda function?

Report Content Errors

A
Implement a Lambda handler function.

Correct. Every Lambda function needs a Lambda-specific handler. Specifics of authoring vary between runtimes, but all runtimes share a common programming model that defines the interface between your code and the runtime code. You tell the runtime which method to run by defining a handler in the function configuration. The runtime runs that method. Next, the runtime passes in objects to the handler that contain the invocation event and context, such as the function name and request ID.

For more information about Lambda, see Getting started with Lambda.

For more information about Lambda features, see Lambda features.

For more information about the Lambda handler function in Java, see AWS Lambda function handler in Java.


B
Import an AWS X-Ray package.

A solutions architect is designing a solution to run a containerized web application by using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The solutions architect wants to minimize cost by running multiple copies of a task on each container instance. The number of task copies must scale as the load increases and decreases.

Which routing solution distributes the load to the multiple tasks?

Report Content Errors

A
Configure an Application Load Balancer to distribute the requests by using path-based routing.

Incorrect. With path-based routing, multiple services can use the same listener port on a single Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB forwards requests to specific target groups based on the URL path. However, this solution does not help with load distribution between different tasks of the same service.

For more information about load balancing, see Service load balancing.


B
Configure an Application Load Balancer to distribute the requests by using dynamic host port mapping.

Correct. With dynamic host port mapping, multiple tasks from the same service are allowed for each container instance.

For more information about load balancing, see Service load balancing.


C
Configure an Amazon Route 53 alias record set to distribute the requests with a failover routing policy.

Incorrect. You can use failover routing policies to route traffic to backup instances, in case a primary instance fails. You cannot use failover routing policies to manage multiple tasks on a single container.

For more information about routing policies, see Choosing a routing policy.


D
Configure an Amazon Route 53 alias record set to distribute the requests with a weighted routing policy.

The usage of a company's image-processing application is increasing suddenly with no set pattern. The application's processing time grows linearly with the size of the image. The processing can take up to 20 minutes for large image files.

The architecture consists of a web tier, an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue, and message consumers that process the images on Amazon EC2 instances. When a high volume of requests occurs, the message backlog in Amazon SQS increases. Users are reporting the delays in processing. A solutions architect must improve the performance of the application in compliance with cloud best practices.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Purchase enough Dedicated Instances to meet the peak demand. Deploy the instances for the consumers.

Incorrect. With Dedicated Instances, you can reduce your costs by using existing server-bound software licenses. However, server-bound licenses are not mentioned in this scenario. One of the benefits of the AWS Cloud is that you do not have to purchase for peak consumption. The AWS Cloud can scale on demand.

For more information about Dedicated Hosts, see Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts Pricing.

For more information about demand-based scaling, see Dynamic Supply.


B
Convert the existing SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Increase the visibility timeout.

Incorrect. FIFO queues will solve problems that occur when messages are processed out of order. FIFO queues will not improve performance during sudden volume increases. Additionally, you cannot convert SQS queues after you create them.

For more information about FIFO queues, see Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues.

For more information about SQS queues, see Editing an Amazon SQS queue (console).


C
Configure a scalable AWS Lambda function as the consumer of the SQS messages.

Incorrect. Some files in this scenario can take up to 20 minutes to process. Lambda has a 15-minute operational limit.

For more information about Lambda constraints, see Lambda quotas.


D
Create a message consumer that is an Auto Scaling group of instances. Configure the Auto Scaling group to scale based upon the ApproximateNumberOfMessages Amazon CloudWatch metric.

Correct. With Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, the processing capacity can keep up with the demand.

An application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer. The EC2 instances are in a single Availability Zone.

What should a solutions architect do to make this architecture more highly available?

Report Content Errors

A
Create a new VPC with two new EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone as the original EC2 instances. Create a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs

Incorrect. VPC peering will provide connectivity to the other Availability Zone. However, VPC peering does not ensure high availability because the EC2 instances are still in one Availability Zone.

For more information about VPC peering, see What is VPC Peering?


B
Replace the Network Load Balancer with an Application Load Balancer that is configured with the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.

Incorrect. The replacement of the Network Load Balancer with an Application Load Balancer provides no additional availability. Both load balancers are inherently highly available. However, the EC2 instances would be highly available only if they extended across two Availability Zones.

For more information about Elastic Load Balancing, see How Elastic Load Balancing works.


C
Configure Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks on the EC2 instances behind the Network Load Balancer. Add a failover routing policy.

Incorrect. Failover routing requires a primary destination and a secondary (failover) destination. No failover destination is specified in this solution. In addition, this approach does not ensure high availability because the EC2 instances are still in one Availability Zone.

For more information about DNS failover, see Configuring DNS failover.


D
Place the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that extends across multiple Availability Zones. Designate the Auto Scaling group as the target of the Network Load Balancer.

A company is using an Amazon S3 bucket to store legal documents. The company frequently revises the documents and re-uploads them with the same object key to the S3 bucket. The company needs the ability to download older copies of the documents. The company also needs to protect the documents from accidental deletion.

What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Enable S3 Versioning on the S3 bucket.

Correct. With S3 Versioning, you can keep multiple variants of an object in the same S3 bucket. You can use S3 Versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object that is stored in your S3 bucket. By using S3 Versioning, you can recover from unintended user actions and application failures.

For more information about S3 Versioning, see How S3 Versioning works.


B
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete on the S3 bucket.

Incorrect. MFA delete provides an additional layer of object security. MFA delete ensures that the entity that deletes the objects possesses an authorized MFA token. However, MFA delete does not meet the document versioning requirements of this question.

For more information about MFA delete, see Configuring MFA delete.


C
Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication from the S3 bucket to an S3 bucket in a different AWS Region.

Incorrect. S3 Cross-Region Replication requires S3 Versioning as a prerequisite. However, S3 Versioning alone meets the requirements of this question and is the more operationally efficient solution.

For information about S3 Cross-Region Replication, see Replicating objects.


D
Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to archive the documents to S3 Glacier after 30 days.

A reporting application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. For complex reports, the application can take up to 15 minutes to respond to a request. A solutions architect is concerned that users will receive HTTP 5xx errors if a report request is in process during a scale-in event.

What should the solutions architect do to ensure that user requests will be completed before instances are terminated?

Report Content Errors

A
Enable sticky sessions (session affinity) for the target group of the instances.

Incorrect. If an EC2 instance were removed from the target group during a scale-in process, the EC2 instance would fail (or would be unhealthy if it were checked). An Application Load Balancer would stop routing requests to that target and would choose a new healthy target.

For more information about sticky sessions, see Sticky sessions for your Application Load Balancer.


B
Increase the instance size in the Application Load Balancer target group.

Incorrect. An increase of the instance size likely would increase the speed of processing. However, this solution does not directly ensure that instances that process a request are unaffected by scale-in actions.

For more information about deregistration delay, see Deregistration delay.


C
Increase the cooldown period for the Auto Scaling group to a greater amount of time than the time required for the longest running responses.

Incorrect. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling cooldown periods help you prevent Auto Scaling groups from launching or terminating additional instances before the effects of previous activities are apparent.

For more information about cooldown periods, see Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.


D
Increase the deregistration delay timeout for the target group of the instances to greater than 900 seconds.

Correct. By default, Elastic Load Balancing waits 300 seconds before the completion of the deregistration process, which can help in-flight requests to the target become complete. To change the amount of time that Elastic Load Balancing waits, update the deregistration delay value.

A company has an on-premises application that exports log files about users of a website. These log files range from 20 GB to 30 GB in size. A solutions architect has created an Amazon S3 bucket to store these files. The files will be uploaded directly from the application. The network connection experiences intermittent failures, and the upload sometimes fails.

A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves this problem. The solution must minimize operational overhead.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration.

Incorrect. S3 Transfer Acceleration facilitates quicker uploads by using edge locations to copy data into Amazon S3. S3 Transfer Acceleration does not solve the problem of the file size limitation (5 GB) for a single PUT operation.

For more information about S3 Transfer Acceleration, see S3 Transfer Acceleration.


B
Copy the files to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest AWS Region. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to copy the log files to Amazon S3.

Incorrect. This solution does not solve the problem of the file size limitation (5 GB) for a single PUT operation. S3 Lifecycle policies cannot transfer files from EC2 block storage to Amazon S3. This solution also adds unnecessary services and operational overhead to the environment.

For more information about Amazon EC2, see What is Amazon EC2?


C
Use multipart upload to Amazon S3.

Correct. With a single PUT operation, you can upload a single object that is up to 5 GB in size. You can use a multipart upload to upload larger files, such as the files in this scenario.

For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload.


D
Upload the files to two AWS Regions simultaneously. Enable two-way Cross-Region Replication between the two Regions.

Incorrect. This solution does not solve the problem of the file size limitation (5 GB) for a single PUT operation. Each destination Region would have the same problem as a single Region. This solution also adds operational overhead.

A company needs to maintain data records for a minimum of 5 years. The data is rarely accessed after it is stored. The data must be accessible within 2 hours.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

Report Content Errors

A
Store the data in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Access the data by using AWS Direct Connect.

Incorrect. This solution is not the most cost-effective solution. Amazon S3 is a more cost-effective solution if there is not a requirement for a file system.

For more information about Amazon EFS and Direct Connect, see How Amazon EFS works with AWS Direct Connect and AWS Managed VPN.


B
Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the data to S3 Glacier.

Correct. The storage of the data in an S3 bucket provides a cost-effective initial location for the data. S3 Glacier is the most cost-effective archival storage solution that meets the requirement of a 2-hour retrieval time.

For more information about how to move data between S3 storage classes automatically, see Managing your storage lifecycle.

For more information about S3 storage classes, see Using Amazon S3 storage classes.


C
Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Create snapshots. Store the snapshots in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Incorrect. This solution is not the most cost-effective solution because it requires the use of Amazon EBS in addition to Amazon S3.

For more information about EBS snapshots, see Amazon EBS snapshots.


D
Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the data to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).

Incorrect. The storage of the data in an S3 bucket provides a cost-effective initial location for the data. However, S3 Standard-IA is not the most cost-effective storage class to meet the requirements in the scenario. The S3 Glacier storage class is designed for low-cost data archiving.

A media company is designing a new solution for graphic rendering. The application requires up to 400 GB of storage for temporary data that is discarded after the frames are rendered. The application requires approximately 40,000 random IOPS to perform the rendering.

What is the MOST cost-effective storage option for this rendering application?

Report Content Errors

A
A storage optimized Amazon EC2 instance with instance store storage

Correct. SSD-Backed Storage Optimized (i2) instances provide more than 365,000 random IOPS. The instance store has no additional cost, compared with the regular hourly cost of the instance.

For more information about pricing for EC2 instances, see Amazon EC2 pricing.


B
A storage optimized Amazon EC2 instance with a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume

Incorrect. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) EBS volumes can deliver more than the 40,000 IOPS that are required in the scenario. However, this solution is not as cost-effective as an instance store because Amazon EBS adds cost to the hourly instance rate. This solution provides persistence of data beyond the lifecycle of the instance, but persistence is not required in this use case.

For more information about Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) EBS volumes, see Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes.

For more information about pricing for Amazon EBS, see Amazon EBS pricing.


C
A burstable Amazon EC2 instance with a Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume

Incorrect. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) EBS volumes are engineered to maximize the throughput of data that can be sent to and from a volume, not the random IOPS. Consequently, this solution does not meet the IOPS requirement. In addition, Amazon EBS adds cost to the hourly instance rate. This solution provides persistence of data beyond the lifecycle of the instance, but persistence is not required in this use case.

For more information about Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) EBS volumes, see Throughput Optimized HDD volumes.

For more information about pricing for Amazon EBS, see Amazon EBS pricing.


D
A burstable Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon S3 storage over a VPC endpoint

Incorrect. The rapidly changing data that is required for the scratch volume space makes Amazon S3 (object storage) the wrong storage. Block storage is appropriate for the read/write functionality to work smoothly.

A company is deploying a new application that will consist of an application layer and an online transaction processing (OLTP) relational database. The application must be available at all times. However, the application will have periods of inactivity. The company wants to pay the minimum for compute costs during these idle periods.

Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

Report Content Errors

A
Run the application in containers with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate. Use Amazon Aurora Serverless for the database.

Correct. When Amazon ECS uses Fargate for compute, it incurs no costs when the application is idle. Aurora Serverless also incurs no compute costs when it is idle.

For more information about Fargate, see AWS Fargate Pricing.

For more information about Aurora Serverless, see Amazon Aurora Serverless.


B
Run the application on Amazon EC2 instances by using a burstable instance type. Use Amazon Redshift for the database.

Incorrect. EC2 burstable instances offer burstable capability without scaling. However, this solution does not minimize cost during the periods of inactivity and is not the most cost-effective option. In addition, an Amazon Redshift database is not ideal for OLTP. Amazon Redshift is specifically designed for online analytic processing (OLAP).

For more information about Amazon Redshift, see What is Amazon Redshift?


C
Deploy the application and a MySQL database to Amazon EC2 instances by using AWS CloudFormation. Delete the stack at the beginning of the idle periods.

Incorrect. Although infrastructure as code (IaC) helps with availability, this solution does not meet the requirement of being always available. In addition, this solution offers no way to keep the database data after the database is recreated.

For more information about CloudFormation, see What is AWS CloudFormation?


D
Deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL for the database.

Incorrect. With this solution, at least one instance and a database will run during the periods of inactivity. This solution does not minimize cost during the periods of inactivity. This solution is not the most cost-effective option.

4.3 Design cost-optimized network architectures

### Question 20

A company that processes satellite images has an application that runs on AWS. The company stores the images in an Amazon S3 bucket. For compliance reasons, the company must replicate all data once a month to an on-premises location. The average amount of data that the company needs to transfer is 60 TB.

What is the MOST cost-effective way to transfer this data?

Report Content Errors

A
Export the data monthly from the existing S3 bucket to an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Ship the device to the on-premises location. Transfer the data. Return the device a week later.

Correct. The base price covers the device and 10 days of usage at the on-premises location. If the company returns the device within a week, the company pays the base price and the price for data transfer out of AWS.

For more information about Snowball pricing, see AWS Snowball Pricing.

B - Use S3 bucket replication to copy all objects to a new S3 bucket that uses S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage. Use an AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway to transfer the data from the new S3 bucket to the on-premises location. Delete the images from the new S3 bucket after the transfer of the data.

Incorrect. There is no cost advantage if the company copies all the data to another S3 bucket that uses S3 Standard-IA storage. The company could transfer the data directly from the original S3 bucket. This solution is not the most cost-effective option because the additional replication increases the cost.

For more information about data transfer pricing for Storage Gateway, see AWS Storage Gateway pricing.

C - Use S3 bucket replication to copy all objects to a new S3 bucket that uses S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage. Use Amazon S3 to transfer the data from the new S3 bucket to the on-premises location. Delete the images from the new S3 bucket after the transfer of the data.

Incorrect. There is no cost advantage if the company copies all the data to another S3 bucket that uses S3 Standard-IA storage. The company could transfer the data directly from the original S3 bucket. This solution is not the most cost-effective option because the additional replication increases the cost.

For more information about S3 data transfer pricing, see Amazon S3 pricing.

D - Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the objects in the existing S3 bucket. Download the objects from CloudFront to the on-premises location every month.

Incorrect. Data transfer to CloudFront is free of cost, but data transfer of 60 TB from CloudFront to an on-premises location incurs a cost. This option would cost approximately twice as much as the option to use the AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device.

For more information about CloudFront data pricing, see Amazon CloudFront Pricing.
